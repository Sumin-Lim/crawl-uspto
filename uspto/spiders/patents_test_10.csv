Each of the parties to a conflict or  dispute to be negotiated enters their preferences concerning each issue of  the conflict into a computer system. If desired, each party to the dispute  can have a separate computer system so that each party's preference  information remains confidential to that party. The preference information  includes data on satisfaction functions for each of the issues which  defines a party's relative level of satisfaction as a function of a  numerical value for the outcome of that issue. Each party may also enter  one or more proposed alternative agreements which provide the party with a  specified level of satisfaction. Using standard mixed integer linear  programming techniques, the preference information is employed to solve an  optimization problem in which an alternative agreement, known as the  common base if accepted by all parties, is first generated that provides  at least the same level of satisfaction to each party that their own  proposal provides, while at the same time minimizing the maximum gain and  satisfaction achieved by any party between their proposal and the  generated alternative agreement. Next, an optimal agreement to the  conflict is determined, again using linear programming techniques, by  maximizing the minimum gain in satisfaction achieved by each of the  parties in going from the common base to the improved alternative. This  will, at the same time, maximize the overall benefit to all of the  parties. For maximum security of all party's confidential information, a  separate computer system located at a neutral site can be connected to  each individual party's computer system. In this case, alternatives are  generated at the neutral site and transmitted back to each party's own  computer system.","February 27, 1996","July 15, 1994"
